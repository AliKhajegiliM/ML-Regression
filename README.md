# ML-Regression
This is my sample code for writing proper code to implement linear regression model, both univariate and multivariate, through gradient descent and from scratch.
This project is in fact a developed and answered version of the CE ML course (2020) at Sharif University of Technology and the data has been taken from the course's materials.

To see the backbone of the code, see the my_answer.py file.
